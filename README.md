# Unhandled Database Errors in Express.js Route Handler

This example demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: failing to handle errors properly during database interactions.  The provided `bug.js` showcases a route handler that fetches user data but lacks error handling for cases where the database query fails. This can lead to server crashes or unexpected behavior.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with comprehensive error handling to gracefully manage database errors and respond with appropriate error codes to the client.
